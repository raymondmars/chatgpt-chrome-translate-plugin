## Common issues   
- **Can't translate the selected text and always show 'Translating...'**   

  **Solution:** Please check your network connection and ensure the AI model’s website (e.g., ChatGPT or others) is accessible. If you require a VPN to access the AI models, confirm that the VPN is turned on. If these steps don't resolve the issue, confirm that you’ve pre-billed your API account, as some models now require pre-billing to use their API.
